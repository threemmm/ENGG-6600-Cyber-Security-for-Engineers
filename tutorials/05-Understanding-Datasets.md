## What is a Dataset?

A dataset is a collection of data points gathered into a structured format. Datasets are used to train machine learning models or perform data analysis. They can come in various forms, such as tables, time-series data, text, or even images and videos.

## Types of Data

Data can be classified into several types based on its characteristics:

### Numerical Data

Numerical data represents quantitative information. It can be either discrete, like integers, or continuous, like real numbers.

#### Example:

- Age
- Salary
- Temperature

### Categorical Data

Categorical data represents qualitative information that can be divided into categories.

#### Example:

- Gender (Male/Female)
- Car Brands (Toyota, Ford, BMW)
- Ratings (Poor, Average, Good)

### Text Data

Text data is unstructured data that consists of words or phrases. It's often used in natural language processing applications.

#### Example:

- Customer Reviews
- News Articles
- Tweets

### Time-Series Data

Time-Series data are data points collected or recorded at different time intervals.

#### Example:

- Stock Prices
- Weather Data
- Traffic Data

## Data Sources

Datasets can be sourced from various file formats and storage solutions:

### CSV

CSV (Comma Separated Values) is a simple file format that stores tabular data. Each line in a CSV file represents a row, and each field in that row is separated by a comma.

### JSON

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy to read and write.

### Databases

Data can also be stored in databases, such as SQL databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL) or NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Cassandra).

## Data Quality

The quality of a dataset is crucial for the performance of a machine learning model. Poor data quality can result from:

- Missing Values
- Outliers
- Duplicate Data
- Imbalanced Data

## Conclusion

Understanding the types and sources of data, as well as the importance of data quality, is fundamental for anyone working in machine learning or data science. A well-understood and well-prepared dataset is the first step towards a successful machine learning project.
