## NumPy

### What is NumPy?

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

### Installation

To install NumPy, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

### Basic Usage

Here's a simple example that creates a NumPy array:

```python
import numpy as np

array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(array)
```

## Pandas

### What is Pandas?

Pandas is an open-source data analysis and data manipulation library. It provides data structures for efficiently storing large amounts of data and time series.

### Installation

To install Pandas, use the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

### Basic Usage

Here's how to create a simple Pandas DataFrame:

```python
import pandas as pd

data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob'], 'Age': [24, 27]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```

## Matplotlib

### What is Matplotlib?

Matplotlib is a plotting library for Python. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications.

### Installation

To install Matplotlib, use:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

### Basic Usage

Here's a simple example to plot a line graph:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot([1, 2, 3, 4])
plt.ylabel('Some Numbers')
plt.show()
```

## Scikit-learn

### What is Scikit-learn?

Scikit-learn is a machine learning library for Python. It features various algorithms like support vector machines, random forests, and k-means.

### Installation

To install Scikit-learn, use:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

### Basic Usage

Here's how to fit a simple linear regression model:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

X = [[1], [2]]
y = [1, 2]
reg = LinearRegression().fit(X, y)
```

## TensorFlow

### What is TensorFlow?

TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google. It's used for a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks.

### Installation

To install TensorFlow, use:

```bash
pip install tensorflow
```

### Basic Usage

Here's a simple TensorFlow example to define a constant:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')
print(hello)
```

## PyTorch

### What is PyTorch?

PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. It's widely used for deep learning and artificial intelligence.

### Installation

To install PyTorch, use:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision
```

### Basic Usage

Here's a simple example to define a tensor in PyTorch:

```python
import torch

x = torch.Tensor([1, 2, 3])
print(x)
```
