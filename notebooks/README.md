## Folder Structure

The `notebooks/` folder is organized as follows:

```
notebooks/
│
├── 00-ML-workshop.ipynb
├── 01-ML-workshop.ipynb
├── 02-ML-workshop.ipynb

## Main Workshop Notebooks

These notebooks are the primary material for the workshop:

1. **`00-ML-workshop.ipynb`**: Introduction to machine learning, important libraries, and initial setups.
2. **`01-ML-workshop.ipynb`**: Dives deeper into specific machine learning algorithms and techniques.
3. **`02-ML-workshop.ipynb`**: Focuses on basic challenges in machine learning.

## Optional Example Notebooks

These are optional notebooks for extra work and further exploration:

1. **`Example01.ipynb`**: Provides additional examples and use-cases related to the topics covered in the main workshop.
2. **`Example02.ipynb`**: Continues to expand on more complex scenarios and techniques.
3. **`Example03.ipynb`**: Serves as a playground for students to experiment and build upon the concepts learned.

## Data Folder

The `data/` folder contains all the data files used in the notebook examples. These may include `.csv`, `.txt`, or `.mat` files that are read into the notebooks for analysis and machine learning tasks.

## Disclaimer

The main workshop notebooks (`00-ML-workshop.ipynb`, `01-ML-workshop.ipynb`, and `02-ML-workshop.ipynb`) are provided by the professor of the course "ENGG 6600 Cyber Security for Engineers." at University of Guelph - Fall 2023.
